# SURF-Light-Pollution-Project

This project, made possible by the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship and Carnegie Mellon University, hopes to determine geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic trends in urban light pollution, using the city of Pittsburgh as a case study.
My research, advised by Diane Turnshek, aims to 1) take light pollution data from as many sites as possible throughout Pittsburgh, 2) map that data using ArcGIS Pro software, and 3) analyze that data in R and Python using US Census Bureau and ACS census data.

Another aspect of this project has been mapping and analyzing LP data in ArcGIS Pro. Some interesting maps are replicated below:
